# SMP_Victoria

Repository for the joint University of Melbourne/Arthur Rylah Institute project on biodiversity knowledge framework and Strategic Management Prospects (SMP).

This repository will version control any relevant scripts and documentation. It will **not** store data or outputs as they are too large.
